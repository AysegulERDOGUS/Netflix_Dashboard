## Netflix Dashboard
This dashboard report is designed with a user-friendly interface that aims to provide insights into marketing strategies. 
While geographical distributions are visualised using cartograms, gender and country-based distributions are also presented in detail. 
Calculations created using DAX codes make the data more meaningful and functional.With different filtering options, users can customise the data according to their needs.

## Data Loading and Conversion Process
During the data loading process, columns containing multiple values were correctly parsed using SQL queries. This transformation allowed the data to be imported into the Power BI environment in a more structured and analyzable format, resulting in a clean and relational data model suitable for both modeling and reporting purposes.

## Dashboard Insight Summary

Age Distribution: Countries with an above-average user age may indicate markets where the younger audience has not been effectively reached. These regions can offer potential for new market expansion.

User Activity Timing: The most active days and hours provide guidance for optimal content release. Content should be prepared ahead of peak usage times to maximize engagement.

First-Day Impact: Despite an increase in content volume, the expected growth in user activity was not observed. This may indicate a need to improve content quality or better align with user interests.
